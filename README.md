## Support Vector Machines - Week 1

Implementing a Support Vector Machine based linear image classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization. The dataset has 50000 images for 10 classes of images (car, cat, deer, frog, ...)

### Usage

* Download the dataset by running `./getdataset.sh` shell script in _SVM-Week1/f16RBE595/data_ 
* Run the `SVM.py` python script to obtain results.

PS - The shell script might not run unless the privileges are correct and it is declared as an executable(Linux)

### Results

As expected, due to poor resolution of the images(32 X 32 X 3) and this being a very naive implementation of the algorithm, the results obtained were not very good.

* Training Accuracy: ~0.38
* Testing Accuraccy: ~0.41

The final template generated by the weight matrix for all the classes shown below indicates a few classes like car, horse, truck and frog resemble a general representation satisfactorily while other class templates are  not very clear.

## Image Parser - Week 6

Generate an intermediate dataset by parsing the XML annotation files for given VOC PASCAL 2012 image dataset. The parser extracts subimages from the JPEGImages folder using the annotations provided in the dataset. [here](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/#devkit)

### Usage

* Launch the gen_int_dataset.py python file from within the src/ folder. Uncomment the line #114 to run the complete parser 
* The VOC Dataset should be downloaded and stored one folder above the python script, i.e. in the same folder as the src/ folder. 
* The final generated dataset will be stored in this same folder with the name classes/. The classes folder will have another 20 individual folders representing the 20 classes and store the corresponding images. 

* A binary will also be generated for the images using the _Pickle_ library  in Python. Storing the image information in a serialized manner shall help make its usage in ML applications easier. Generated binary should have the name p_dataset.pkl

### Results

* All the images parsed to subimages and stored within individual class folder have been resized to 224 x 224 pixel resolution with restored quality

## Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks for MNIST Handwritten Digit recognition - Week 7

Create an basic MLP neural network and another CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data available by default through the Keras library. 

### Usage

* Run the _mlp_mnist_data.py_ and _cnn_mnist_data.py_ to execute the MLP and CNN implementation of image classification.
* The MNIST dataset should be automatically downloaded from the keras remote
* Modify the various other hyperparameters in the code.

## Face Recognition Using Deep Learning - Week 10

### STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT

A complete face recognition pipeline that takes in various videos of people, parses them to images as per input frames per second available in the video, extracts the face from the complete image using OpenCV cascade filters and then uses DeepLearning (Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify the faces for different people.

## File Description

* _extract_video_frames.py_: Extracts individual frames from videos and creates dataset 
* _extract_faces.py_: Extracts only the face region from any image
* _face_recognition_cnn.py_: Uses the CNN deep network to run classification 
* _reduce_data.py_: Extracts certain number images from the complete dataset and creates Keras processible dataset with training, testing and validation data

## Usage

The complete pipeline is based on _make_ utility system and uses a _Makefile_

All the `make` commands should be run from the base directory, i.e. from _face-recognition-Homework-7-8_

### Data Preparation

* Record videos of the face/face-focused body and store them inside the _videos_ folder within the sub-folder _class_name_
* Run command `make install-dependencies` to install all the system dependencies
* Run command `make images` to generate dataset with images extracted from all the videos and accumulated below _images/class_name_
* Optional -  Run command `make detect-faces` to extract the specific facial zones from all the images generated above to working on specifically facial regions  in the images as a simplified image classification problem

* Run command `make reduce-dataset` to create a version of the as proper data under train, test and valid folders

### Face Recognition

* Run command `make recognize_faces` to run a CNN deep network that works on the supplied images to classify images on the classes from the training data.
